description: "Autonomous long-running iteration for Codex CLI. Use when the user wants Codex to plan or run an unattended improve-verify loop toward a measurable or verifiable outcome, especially for overnight runs; it also covers repeated debugging, fixing, security auditing, and ship-readiness workflows. Do not use for ordinary one-shot coding help or casual Q&A."

# codex-autoresearch

Autonomous goal-directed iteration. Modify -> Verify -> Keep/Discard -> Repeat.

## When Activated

1. Classify the request as `loop`, `plan`, `debug`, `fix`, `security`, `ship`, or `exec`.
2. Load `references/core-principles.md` and `references/structured-output-spec.md`.
3. Load `references/results-logging.md` when a results log is needed.
4. Check the launch/runtime state and load `references/session-resume-protocol.md` when resuming or controlling an existing run.
5. Load `references/environment-awareness.md` to probe hardware and toolchains.
6. Load `references/interaction-wizard.md` only if required fields are missing (not for `exec` mode).
7. Load the mode-specific workflow reference.
8. Load cross-cutting protocols for iterating modes: `references/lessons-protocol.md`, `references/pivot-protocol.md`, `references/health-check-protocol.md`.
9. Optionally load `references/hypothesis-perspectives.md`, `references/parallel-experiments-protocol.md`, `references/web-search-protocol.md` based on configuration.
10. Parse inline config from the user prompt or skill mention.
11. Use the bundled helper scripts for stateful artifacts and runtime control when they apply. Resolve them relative to the loaded skill bundle root (`<skill-root>/scripts/...`), not the target repo root. In the common repo-local install this means commands such as `python3 .agents/skills/codex-autoresearch/scripts/autoresearch_init_run.py ...`.
12. Execute the selected workflow exactly as written.
13. Produce the required structured output and artifacts.

## Core Loop

1. Read the relevant context.
2. Define a mechanical success metric.
3. Establish a baseline.
4. Make one focused change.
5. Verify with a command.
6. Keep or discard the change.
7. Log the result.
8. Repeat.

## Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Primary Reference |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `loop` | Run the autonomous improvement loop | `references/autonomous-loop-protocol.md` |
| `plan` | Convert a vague goal into a launch-ready config | `references/plan-workflow.md` |
| `debug` | Hunt bugs with evidence and hypotheses | `references/debug-workflow.md` |
| `fix` | Iteratively reduce errors to zero | `references/fix-workflow.md` |
| `security` | Run a structured security audit | `references/security-workflow.md` |
| `ship` | Gate and execute a ship workflow | `references/ship-workflow.md` |
| `exec` | Non-interactive CI/CD mode with JSON output | `references/exec-workflow.md` |

Use `Mode: <name>` in the prompt to force a specific subworkflow.

## Load Order

1. `references/core-principles.md` (always)
2. `references/structured-output-spec.md` (always)
3. `references/session-resume-protocol.md` (check for prior run)
4. `references/environment-awareness.md` (probe hardware and toolchains)
5. `references/results-logging.md` (when a results log is needed)
6. `references/interaction-wizard.md` (when required fields are missing, not for exec mode)
7. `references/autonomous-loop-protocol.md` (shared loop mechanics for all iterating modes)
8. `references/{mode}-workflow.md` (mode-specific -- loop mode uses autonomous-loop-protocol directly)
9. `references/lessons-protocol.md` (iterating modes -- cross-run learning)
10. `references/pivot-protocol.md` (iterating modes -- smart stuck recovery)
11. `references/health-check-protocol.md` (iterating modes -- self-monitoring)
12. `references/hypothesis-perspectives.md` (when multi-lens reasoning is beneficial)
13. `references/parallel-experiments-protocol.md` (when parallel mode is enabled)
14. `references/web-search-protocol.md` (when web search is available and enabled)

## Required Config

For the generic loop, the following fields are needed internally. Codex infers them from the user's natural language input and repo context, then fills gaps through guided conversation:

- `Goal`
- `Scope`
- `Metric`
- `Direction`
- `Verify`

Optional but recommended:

- `Guard`
- `Iterations`
- `Run tag`
- `Stop condition`

If required fields are missing, use the wizard contract in `references/interaction-wizard.md`.

## Single Entry Runtime

- `$codex-autoresearch` is the only primary human-facing entrypoint.
- For a new interactive run, scan the repo, ask the confirmation questions, then when the user says `go` call `autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py launch` to persist the confirmed launch manifest and start the detached runtime controller in one step. The runtime itself should execute non-interactive `codex exec` sessions with the generated runtime prompt supplied on stdin. If the mini-wizard outcome is "fresh start", call `autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py launch --fresh-start` so prior persistent run-control artifacts are archived as part of the same handoff.
- For `status`, `stop`, or `resume` requests, stay on the same skill entry and use the runtime control scripts instead of asking the user to switch commands.
- `exec` remains the advanced / CI path. It is fully specified upfront and does not use the interactive handoff.

## Hard Rules

1. **Ask before act for new interactive launches.** For `loop`, `debug`, `fix`, `security`, and `ship`, ALWAYS scan the repo and ask at least one round of clarifying questions before creating a new launch manifest. `exec` mode is the exception: it is fully configured upfront and must not stop for a launch question.
2. **Handoff to the runtime after launch approval.** In interactive modes, once the user says "go" (or equivalent: "start", "launch", or any clear approval), call `autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py launch` so the confirmed launch manifest and detached runtime are created as a single script-level action. The runtime should continue through non-interactive `codex exec` sessions, not through the interactive TUI. If the chosen path is a fresh start after recovery analysis, use `autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py launch --fresh-start` so stale persistent run-control artifacts are archived automatically. Do not keep the long-running loop in the same foreground turn. `exec` mode has no launch question; once safety checks pass, it begins immediately.
3. **Never ask after launch.** Once the launch manifest exists and the runtime is active, do not pause mid-run to ask the user anything -- not for clarification, not for confirmation, not for permission. If you encounter ambiguity during the loop, apply best practices and keep going. The user may be asleep.
4. Read all in-scope files before the first write.
5. One focused change per iteration.
6. Mechanical verification only.
7. Commit before verification only when `git status --porcelain` shows no changes outside the experiment scope or autoresearch-owned artifacts. The detached runtime enforces the same scope-aware gate before each relaunch boundary, but inside a live Codex session you must still honor it before creating a trial commit.
8. Never stage or revert unrelated user changes.
9. Keep run artifacts uncommitted and never stage them.
10. Use the rollback strategy approved during setup. In a dedicated experiment branch/worktree with pre-launch approval, `git reset --hard HEAD~1` is allowed; otherwise use `git revert --no-edit HEAD`.
11. Discard gains under 1% that add disproportionate complexity.
12. Unlimited runs by default unless the user explicitly asks for `Iterations: N`.
13. External ship actions (deploy, publish, release) must be confirmed during the pre-launch wizard phase. If not confirmed before launch, skip them and log as blocker.
14. Do not ask "should I continue?". Once launched, keep the managed runtime active until interrupted or a hard blocker / configured terminal condition appears (see `references/autonomous-loop-protocol.md` Stop Conditions for the full definition).
15. When stuck (3+ consecutive discards), use the PIVOT/REFINE escalation ladder from `references/pivot-protocol.md` instead of brute-force retrying.
16. Extract lessons after every kept iteration and every pivot (see `references/lessons-protocol.md`).
17. Prefer the bundled helper scripts over hand-editing `research-results.tsv`, `autoresearch-state.json`, or runtime-control files. Always call them via the skill-bundle path (`<skill-root>/scripts/...`); never call bare `scripts/autoresearch_*.py` from the target repo root unless the skill bundle itself is actually installed there.
18. In `exec` mode, never leave repo-root `autoresearch-state.json` behind. If helper scripts need state, use the exec scratch path and explicitly clean it up before exit.
19. After any context compaction event (the CLI warns about thread length and compaction), re-read `references/autonomous-loop-protocol.md` and `references/core-principles.md` from disk before the next iteration. Do not rely on memory of these documents after compaction.
20. Every 10 iterations, perform the Protocol Fingerprint Check defined in Phase 8.7 of `references/autonomous-loop-protocol.md`. If any item fails, re-read all loaded protocol files from disk before continuing.

## Structured Output

Every mode should follow `references/structured-output-spec.md`.

Minimum requirement:

- for interactive and user-facing modes, print a setup summary before the loop starts,
- for interactive and user-facing modes, print progress updates during the loop,
- for interactive and user-facing modes, print a completion summary at the end,
- for `exec`, emit only the machine-readable JSON payloads defined in `references/exec-workflow.md`,
- write the mode-specific output files when the workflow defines an output directory.

## Quick Start

```text
$codex-autoresearch
I want to get rid of all the `any` types in my TypeScript code
```

```text
$codex-autoresearch
I want to make our API faster but I don't know where to start
```

```text
$codex-autoresearch
pytest is failing, 12 tests broken after the refactor
```

Codex scans the repo, asks targeted questions to clarify your intent, then starts the loop. You never need to write key-value config.
