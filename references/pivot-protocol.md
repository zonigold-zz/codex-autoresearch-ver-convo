# PIVOT / REFINE Decision Framework

Smart stuck recovery that replaces the blunt "5 discards -> re-read" heuristic with a graduated escalation system.

## Definitions

- **REFINE:** Adjust within the current strategy. Change parameters, scope, or approach details without abandoning the overall direction.
- **PIVOT:** Abandon the current strategy entirely. Try a fundamentally different approach to the same goal.

## Escalation Ladder

### Level 1: REFINE (3 consecutive discards)

Trigger: 3 consecutive iterations with status `discard`, `crash`, or `no-op`.

Actions:
1. Re-read the last 10 results log entries.
2. Identify what is common across the failed attempts (same file? same pattern? same assumption?).
3. Consult `autoresearch-lessons.md` for insights on similar failures.
4. Generate a hypothesis that differs from recent attempts in at least one concrete dimension:
   - Different file within scope
   - Different technique (e.g., switch from refactoring to adding new code)
   - Different granularity (smaller or larger change)
5. Log the decision as status `refine` in the results TSV.

### Level 2: PIVOT (5 consecutive discards, including any refines)

Trigger: 5 consecutive non-keep iterations since the last keep (refines count toward this).

Actions:
1. Re-read all in-scope files from scratch.
2. Re-read the original goal.
3. Review the entire results log for patterns.
4. Explicitly name the strategy being abandoned and why.
5. Choose a fundamentally different approach:
   - If previous attempts were incremental, try a structural change.
   - If previous attempts targeted one file, try a cross-file approach.
   - If previous attempts added code, try removing or simplifying.
   - If previous attempts were conservative, try a bolder change.
6. Consult lessons for successful strategies in different contexts.
7. Log the decision as status `pivot` in the results TSV.

### Level 3: Web Search Escalation (2 PIVOTs without improvement)

Trigger: 2 PIVOT decisions have been made since the last keep, with no improvement.

Actions:
1. Formulate a targeted search query based on the current blocker.
2. Follow `references/web-search-protocol.md` for search execution.
3. Treat search results as hypotheses -- still verify mechanically.
4. Log the search as status `search` in the results TSV.

### Level 4: Soft Blocker Warning (3 PIVOTs without improvement)

Trigger: 3 PIVOT decisions without any keep since the first pivot.

Actions:
1. Print a progress warning:
   ```
   [WARNING] 3 strategy pivots without improvement. The goal may require
   manual intervention, broader scope, or a different metric.
   Continuing with best-effort attempts.
   ```
2. Continue iterating (do not stop -- the user may be asleep).
3. Switch to increasingly bold, architecture-level changes.
4. Log each subsequent attempt with a `[SOFT-BLOCKER]` prefix in the description column. Note: `soft-blocker` is a description annotation, not a status value. The `status` column should reflect the actual outcome (`discard`, `keep`, `crash`, etc.).

## Counting Rules

- Only consecutive non-keep iterations count toward escalation thresholds.
- A single `keep` resets all counters to zero.
- `baseline` status does not count toward escalation.
- `blocked` status triggers a hard stop, not escalation.

### Status-by-Status Escalation Effect

| Status | Counts toward REFINE (3)? | Counts toward PIVOT (5)? | Resets counters? |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| `keep` | no | no | **yes -- resets all** |
| `discard` | yes | yes | no |
| `crash` | yes | yes | no |
| `no-op` | yes | yes | no |
| `refine` | no (it IS the refine) | yes (counts as non-keep) | no |
| `pivot` | no (it IS the pivot) | no (it IS the pivot) | no |
| `search` | no (search is an action, not an outcome) | no | no |
| `drift` | no (environmental, not strategic) | no | no |
| `baseline` | no | no | no |
| `blocked` | triggers hard stop | triggers hard stop | n/a |

### PIVOT-Level Counting

The "2 PIVOTs without improvement" threshold for Level 3 counts PIVOT decisions only:
- A PIVOT decision increments the pivot counter.
- A `keep` after a PIVOT resets the pivot counter to zero.
- Consecutive PIVOTs without any intervening `keep` accumulate toward Level 3 and Level 4.

## Logging

### Results TSV Additions

Two new status values:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `refine` | Strategy adjustment within current approach |
| `pivot` | Strategy abandoned, fundamentally new approach |

The `description` column should include:
- For `refine`: what was adjusted and why
- For `pivot`: what strategy was abandoned and what replaces it

### Example

```tsv
# metric_direction: lower
iteration	commit	metric	delta	guard	status	description
0	a1b2c3d	47	0	-	baseline	initial any count
1	b2c3d4e	41	-6	pass	keep	type-narrow auth module
2	c3d4e5f	43	+2	-	discard	generic wrapper attempt
3	d4e5f6a	45	+4	-	discard	broader type union
4	-	41	0	-	refine	[REFINE] shifting from auth to api layer
5	c3d4e5f	38	-3	pass	keep	narrow api response handlers
```

## Integration with Lessons

After every PIVOT:
- Extract a lesson per `references/lessons-protocol.md`.
- Record which strategy family was abandoned and the iteration cost.
- This data feeds future runs so they can skip known dead-end strategies earlier.
