## Quick Start

**1. Install:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leo-lilinxiao/codex-autoresearch.git
cp -r codex-autoresearch your-project/.agents/skills/codex-autoresearch
```

Or use the skill installer in Codex:
```text
$skill-installer install https://github.com/leo-lilinxiao/codex-autoresearch
```

**2. Open Codex in your project and say what you want:**

```text
$codex-autoresearch
I want to get rid of all the `any` types in my TypeScript code
```

**3. Codex scans, confirms, then iterates autonomously:**

```
Codex: I found 47 `any` occurrences across src/**/*.ts.

       Confirmed:
       - Target: eliminate `any` types in src/**/*.ts
       - Metric: `any` count (current: 47), direction: lower
       - Verify: grep + tsc --noEmit as guard

       Need to confirm:
       - Run mode: foreground or background?
       - Run until all gone, or cap at N iterations?

       Runtime checklist:
       - baseline first, then initialize results/state
       - record every completed experiment before the next one starts

       Choose a run mode, then reply "go" to start, or tell me what to change.

       For truly unattended runs, launch Codex with approvals / sandbox settings
       that will not interrupt git commit or revert commands.

You:   Background, go. Run overnight.

Codex: Starting background run -- baseline: 47. Detached runtime is now iterating.
```

Each improvement stacks. Each failure reverts. Everything is logged.

See [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for more install options. See [GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md) for full operator's manual.

## What It Does

A Codex skill that runs a modify-verify-decide loop on your codebase. Each iteration makes one atomic change, verifies it against a mechanical metric, and keeps or discards the result. Progress accumulates in git; failures auto-revert. Best for unattended runs where you want Codex to keep pushing toward a measurable result for minutes, hours, or overnight.

Inspired by [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) principles, generalized beyond ML.

### Why This Exists

Karpathy's autoresearch proved that a simple loop -- modify, verify, keep or discard, repeat -- can push ML training from baseline to new highs overnight. codex-autoresearch generalizes that loop to everything in software engineering that has a number. Test coverage, type errors, performance latency, lint warnings -- if there is a metric, it can iterate autonomously.

---

## Architecture

```
              +----------------------+
              |  Environment Probe   |  <-- detect CPU/GPU/RAM/toolchains
              +----------+-----------+
                         |
              +----------v-----------+
              |   Session Resume?    |  <-- inspect prior results/state
              +----------+-----------+
                         |
              +----------v-----------+
              |   Read Context       |  <-- scope + lessons + repo state
              +----------+-----------+
                         |
              +----------v-----------+
              |   Wizard Confirm     |  <-- goal/metric/verify/guard
              | + choose run mode    |      + foreground or background
              +----------+-----------+
                         |
               +---------+---------+
               |                   |
     +---------v--------+  +-------v---------+
     | Foreground run   |  | Background run  |
     | current session  |  | launch manifest |
     | no runtime files |  | + detached ctl  |
     +---------+--------+  +-------+---------+
               |                   |
               +---------+---------+
                         |
              +----------v-----------+
              |   Shared Loop Core   |
              |  baseline -> change  |
              |  -> verify/guard ->  |
              |  keep/discard/log    |
              +----------+-----------+
                         |
              +----------v-----------+
              |  Supervisor Outcome  |  <-- continue / stop / needs_human
              +----------------------+
```

Foreground and background share the same experiment protocol. The difference is only where the loop executes: the current Codex session for foreground, or the detached runtime controller for background. Unbounded runs continue until you interrupt them or another terminal condition is reached (goal/stop condition satisfied, soft-blocker handoff, or hard blocker). Bounded runs follow the same terminal conditions, but also stop at `Iterations: N`.

The runtime checklist stays intentionally small in both modes:

- baseline before init
- record every completed experiment before the next one starts
- use helper scripts for authoritative state and log updates

**In pseudocode:**

```
PHASE 0: Probe environment, check for session resume
PHASE 1: Read context + lessons file
PHASE 2: Confirm config + choose foreground or background

IF foreground:
  run the loop in the current Codex session
ELSE background:
  write autoresearch-launch.json and start the detached runtime

SHARED LOOP (forever or N times):
  1. Review current state + git history + results log + lessons
  2. Pick ONE hypothesis (apply perspectives, filter by environment)
     -- or N hypotheses if parallel mode is active
  3. Make ONE atomic change
  4. git commit (before verification)
  5. Run mechanical verification + guard
  6. Improved -> keep (extract lesson). Worse -> approved rollback strategy. Crashed -> fix or skip.
  7. Log the result
  8. Health check (disk, git, verify health)
  9. If 3+ discards -> REFINE; 5+ -> PIVOT; 2 PIVOTs -> web search
  10. Repeat until the stop condition, manual stop, needs_human, or the configured iteration cap.
```

## How It Works

You say what you want in one sentence. Codex does the rest.

It scans your repo, proposes a plan, confirms with you, then iterates autonomously:

| You say | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| "Improve my test coverage" | Scans repo, proposes metric, iterates until target or interrupted |
| "Fix the 12 failing tests" | Detects failures, repairs one by one until zero remain |
| "Why is the API returning 503?" | Hunts root cause with falsifiable hypotheses and evidence |
| "Is this code secure?" | Runs STRIDE + OWASP audit, every finding backed by code evidence |
| "Ship it" | Verifies readiness, generates checklist, gates release |
| "I want to optimize but don't know what to measure" | Analyzes repo, suggests metrics, generates launch-ready config |

Behind the scenes, Codex maps your sentence to one of 7 specialized modes
(loop, plan, debug, fix, security, ship, exec). You never need to pick a mode --
just describe your goal.

---

## What Codex Figures Out

Codex infers everything from your sentence and your repo. You never write config.

| What it needs | How it gets it | Example |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Goal | Your sentence | "get rid of all any types" |
| Scope | Scans repo structure | auto-discovers src/**/*.ts |
| Metric | Proposes based on goal + tooling | any count (current: 47) |
| Direction | Infers from "improve" / "reduce" / "eliminate" | lower |
| Verify command | Matches to repo tooling | grep count + tsc --noEmit |
| Guard (optional) | Suggests if regression risk exists | npm test |

Before starting, Codex always shows you what it found and asks you to confirm.
One round of confirmation minimum, up to five if needed. Then you choose foreground or background and say "go". Foreground keeps iterating in the current session; background hands off to detached runtime so you can walk away.
For truly unattended runs, start Codex CLI with approvals / sandbox settings that will not interrupt git commit or revert commands. In a disposable or otherwise trusted repo, giving Codex fuller permissions is the simplest option.
After launch, the most important execution rule is simple: every completed experiment must be recorded before the next one begins.

If your goal has a structural requirement in addition to a metric threshold, Codex can also gate both retention and stopping on structured labels. For example: "only retain results that use the `production-path`, and stop only when latency <= 120 ms and the retained keep is labeled `production-path` and `real-backend`." This avoids both falsely retaining and falsely stopping on a numerically better result that came from the wrong mechanism, subsystem, or implementation path.

### Dual-gate verification

Two commands and two optional label gates serve different purposes:

- **Verify** = "Did the target metric improve?" (measures progress)
- **Guard** = "Did anything else break?" (prevents regressions)
- **Required keep labels** = "May this improvement enter retained state at all?"
- **Required stop labels** = "May this retained result satisfy the stop condition?"

```text
Verify: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term 2>&1 | grep TOTAL | awk '{print $NF}'   # did coverage go up?
Guard: npx tsc --noEmit                                                              # do types still pass?

When launching via the runtime helpers, prefer repeating `--guard` for multiple guards instead of
joining them into one shell-specific command string. Single-guard runs still work unchanged.
```

If verify passes but guard fails, the change is reworked (up to 2 attempts). Guard files are never modified.

---

## Mode Details

### loop

The default mode. Iterates toward a measurable target.

```
You:   Get rid of all `any` types in my TypeScript code

Codex: Found 47 `any` in src/**/*.ts.

       Confirmed:
       - Target: eliminate all `any` types
       - Metric: count of `any` (current: 47), direction: lower
       - Verify: grep count, Guard: tsc --noEmit

       Need to confirm:
       - Run mode: foreground or background?
       - Run until zero, or cap at N iterations?

       Choose a run mode, then reply "go" to start.

You:   Background, go. Overnight.

Codex: Starting background run. Baseline first, then detached iterations.
```

### plan

Converts a vague goal into a validated loop configuration.

```
You:   I want to make our API faster but I don't know where to start

Codex: I scanned the repo. API layer is in src/api/ with Express + Prisma.

       Need to confirm:
       - What matters more: p95 latency, throughput, or cold start?
       - Should I benchmark the whole API or specific endpoints?

       Reply with your priority.

You:   p95 latency, the /search endpoint is the worst.
```

### debug

Evidence-driven bug hunting. Each iteration tests one falsifiable hypothesis.

```
You:   Our API returns 503 randomly under load, no idea why

Codex: I see connection pooling in src/db/pool.ts, rate limiting in src/middleware/,
       and 3 async handlers without error boundaries.

       Confirmed:
       - Symptom: intermittent 503 under concurrent load
       - Scope: src/api/, src/db/, src/middleware/

       Need to confirm:
       - When did this start? After a specific change, or always?
       - If I find the cause, should I also fix it?

       Reply with context.

You:   Started after the connection pool refactor last week. Find cause first.
```

### fix

Iteratively repairs errors until the count reaches zero.

```
You:   pytest is failing, 12 tests broken after the refactor

Codex: I see 12 failures across tests/.

       Confirmed:
       - Target: make all pytest tests pass
       - Current: 12 failures

       Need to confirm:
       - Run mode: foreground or background?
       - Should I also guard with ruff to avoid introducing lint issues?
       - Fix all 12, or focus on a specific module first?

       Choose a run mode, then reply "go" to start.

You:   Foreground. Fix all, yes guard with ruff. Go.
```

### security

Read-only STRIDE + OWASP + red-team audit. Every finding requires code evidence.

```
You:   Check our API for injection vulnerabilities

Codex: Confirmed:
       - Scope: src/api/ and src/middleware/ (14 files)
       - Focus: SQL injection, XSS, input sanitization

       Need to confirm:
       - Report only, or also fix critical findings?
       - Should I also cover auth/access control?

       Reply with preference.

You:   Report first, and yes cover auth too.
```

### ship

Gated release verification. Auto-detects what you are shipping (PR, deployment, release).

Internally, ship mode still derives a shipment scope, a readiness metric, and a mechanical verify command from the checklist before the chosen run mode begins.

```
You:   Ship it

Codex: Detected: PR to main with 3 commits.

       Confirmed:
       - Type: code PR
       - Target: main branch

       Need to confirm:
       - Run mode: foreground or background?
       - Dry run first, or go live?
       - Post-ship monitoring? (5 min / 15 min / skip)

       Choose a run mode and shipping preference.

You:   Foreground, dry run first.
```

See [GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md) for detailed usage and advanced options for each mode.

---

## Mode Chaining

Modes can be composed sequentially:

```
plan  -->  loop              # figure out config, then execute
debug -->  fix               # find bugs, then repair them
security + fix               # audit and remediate in one pass
```

---

## Cross-Run Learning

Every iterating run except `exec` extracts structured lessons -- what worked, what failed, and why. Lessons are persisted in `autoresearch-lessons.md` (uncommitted, like the results log) and consulted at the start of future runs to bias hypothesis generation toward proven strategies and away from known dead ends. `exec` mode may read existing lessons, but it never creates or updates them.

- Positive lessons after every kept iteration
- Strategic lessons after every PIVOT decision
- Summary lessons at run completion
- Capacity target: keep the historical archive at roughly 50 entries while preserving current-run lessons verbatim; older history is summarized with time decay

See `references/lessons-protocol.md` for details.

---

## Smart Stuck Recovery

Instead of blindly retrying after failures, the loop uses a graduated escalation system:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 3 consecutive discards | **REFINE** -- adjust within current strategy |
| 5 consecutive discards | **PIVOT** -- abandon strategy, try fundamentally different approach |
| 2 PIVOTs without improvement | **Web search** -- look for external solutions |
| 3 PIVOTs without improvement | **Soft blocker** -- stop the current run and report that human input, broader scope, or a better metric is needed |

A single successful keep resets all counters. See `references/pivot-protocol.md`.

---

## Parallel Experiments

Test multiple hypotheses simultaneously using subagent workers in isolated git worktrees:

```
Orchestrator (main agent)
  +-- Worker A (worktree-a) -> hypothesis 1
  +-- Worker B (worktree-b) -> hypothesis 2
  +-- Worker C (worktree-c) -> hypothesis 3
```

The orchestrator picks the best result, merges it, and discards the rest. Enable during the wizard by saying "yes" to parallel experiments. Falls back to serial if worktrees are unsupported.

See `references/parallel-experiments-protocol.md`.

---

## Session Resume

If Codex detects a prior interrupted run, it can resume from the last consistent state instead of starting over. The primary recovery source is `autoresearch-state.json`, a compact state snapshot atomically updated each iteration. The TSV results log serves as a cross-validation fallback. Foreground resume uses `research-results.tsv` plus `autoresearch-state.json`. Background resume still requires an existing `autoresearch-launch.json`; if that confirmed launch state is missing, switch back to a fresh interactive launch flow.

Recovery priority:

1. **JSON + TSV summary consistent:** resume immediately; background runs additionally require a confirmed launch manifest
2. **JSON valid, helper reports mismatch:** mini-wizard (1 round) to re-confirm
3. **JSON missing or corrupt, TSV exists:** helper reconstructs retained state for confirmation, then continue in the chosen mode
4. **Neither exists:** fresh start (prior persistent run-control artifacts archived)

See `references/session-resume-protocol.md`.

---

## CI/CD Mode (exec)

Non-interactive mode for automation pipelines. All config is provided upfront -- no wizard, always bounded, JSON output.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Autoresearch optimization
  run: |
    codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox <<'PROMPT'
    $codex-autoresearch
    Mode: exec
    Goal: Reduce type errors
    Scope: src/**/*.ts
    Metric: type error count
    Direction: lower
    Verify: tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -c error
    Iterations: 20
    PROMPT
```

Exit codes: 0 = improved, 1 = no improvement, 2 = hard blocker.

Before using `codex exec` in CI, configure Codex CLI authentication in advance. In controlled automation environments, prefer `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox ...` so standalone exec runs match the managed runtime's default `danger_full_access` policy. For programmatic runs, API key authentication is the preferred option.

When the bundled helper scripts drive `Mode: exec`, let `autoresearch_init_run.py --mode exec ...` archive prior repo-root artifacts automatically. With the default filenames it rotates `research-results.tsv` to `research-results.prev.tsv` and `autoresearch-state.json` to `autoresearch-state.prev.json`; do not hand-rename those files first. Also keep `autoresearch_exec_state.py --cleanup` as the final serial helper step, after the last `autoresearch_record_iteration.py` / `autoresearch_select_parallel_batch.py` call.

See `references/exec-workflow.md`.

---

## Results Log

Every iteration is recorded in complementary artifacts:

- **`research-results.tsv`** -- full audit trail, with one main row per iteration plus optional parallel worker rows
- **`autoresearch-state.json`** -- compact state snapshot for fast foreground resume and shared retained-state recovery
- **`autoresearch-launch.json`** -- confirmed launch manifest for background runs only
- **`autoresearch-runtime.json`** -- background runtime control state (PID, status, last decision)
- **`autoresearch-runtime.log`** -- background runtime log for long runs

In `exec` mode, the state snapshot is scratch-only under `/tmp/codex-autoresearch-exec/...`. The exec workflow is responsible for removing that scratch JSON before exit, typically via `autoresearch_exec_state.py --cleanup`. Run that cleanup only after the final stateful helper call has finished. The default helper flow also archives prior repo-root `research-results.tsv` and `autoresearch-state.json` to `research-results.prev.tsv` and `autoresearch-state.prev.json` automatically before the new exec run starts.

```
iteration  commit   metric  delta   status    description
0          a1b2c3d  47      0       baseline  initial any count
1          b2c3d4e  41      -6      keep      replace any in auth module with strict types
2          c3d4e5f  49      +8      discard   generic wrapper introduced new anys
3          c3d4e5f  38      -3      keep      type-narrow API response handlers
```

These files stay uncommitted and are treated as autoresearch-owned artifacts, not normal experiment diffs. On session resume, the JSON state is cross-validated against a reconstructed TSV main-iteration summary instead of raw row counts. Progress summaries print every 5 iterations. Bounded runs print a final baseline-to-best summary.

Stateful artifact updates are backed by bundled helper scripts under `<skill-root>/scripts/`, but most users should keep using the single human-facing entrypoint: **`$codex-autoresearch`**. Here `<skill-root>` means the directory containing the loaded `SKILL.md`; in the common repo-local install this is `.agents/skills/codex-autoresearch`.

If you are not automating or debugging the control plane itself, you can stop here and ignore the raw helper commands below.

When you are scripting or debugging the control plane directly, repo-managed helpers are repo-first by default. Prefer:

- `python3 <skill-root>/scripts/autoresearch_resume_check.py --repo <repo>`
- `python3 <skill-root>/scripts/autoresearch_launch_gate.py --repo <repo>`
- `python3 <skill-root>/scripts/autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py status --repo <repo>`
- `python3 <skill-root>/scripts/autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py stop --repo <repo>`

`--results-path`, `--state-path`, `--launch-path`, and `--runtime-path` remain available as advanced overrides when you need non-standard artifact locations or repo-external scripting. The same repo-first convention also applies to `autoresearch_resume_prompt.py` and `autoresearch_supervisor_status.py` when you invoke those helpers directly.

Human-facing usage now has a single entrypoint: **`$codex-autoresearch`**.

- First interactive run: describe the goal naturally, answer the confirmation questions, choose **foreground** or **background**, then reply `go`.
- **Foreground** keeps the loop in the current Codex session. It writes `research-results.tsv`, `autoresearch-state.json`, and lessons, but does not create launch/runtime control files.
- **Background** calls `autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py launch`, atomically writes `autoresearch-launch.json`, and starts the detached runtime controller.
- Foreground and background share the same loop protocol, metric semantics, and repo/scope rules, but they are mutually exclusive for a given repo/run. Do not run both modes at the same time against the same primary repo artifacts.
- If you resume an existing interactive run in the other mode, keep using the same `$codex-autoresearch` entrypoint. The shared state must be synchronized to the chosen mode before continuing; scripted background `start` does that automatically, and the interactive skill flow should handle the same step for foreground continuation.
- Single-repo runs remain the default: the declared scope applies to the primary repo that owns the run-control artifacts.
- For cross-repo experiments, both modes can declare companion repos with their own scopes. `research-results.tsv` and `autoresearch-state.json` remain anchored in the primary repo, and background mode also keeps launch/runtime control files there.
- In that model, the TSV `commit` column still tracks the primary repo commit, while `autoresearch-state.json` can carry per-repo commit provenance for companion repos.
- Script-level entrypoints accept repeated `--companion-repo-scope PATH=SCOPE` flags when you need to seed that structure directly.
- Each background runtime cycle launches a non-interactive `codex exec` session with the runtime prompt fed on stdin, so it does not depend on the interactive TUI.
- `execution_policy` applies only to paths that spawn nested Codex sessions: background managed runs and `exec`. In this skill the default is `danger_full_access`, which means detached Codex sessions run with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` unless a caller explicitly opts into the sandboxed `workspace_write` path.
- If the background runtime cannot launch that `codex exec` session at all, it transitions to `needs_human` instead of silently falling back to an idle state.
- If an explicit stop request cannot actually terminate the detached runner, the background runtime also transitions to `needs_human` instead of pretending the run is fully stopped.
- Before the background runtime starts a session or relaunches one, it runs a script-level preflight: `autoresearch_health_check.py` for integrity checks and `autoresearch_commit_gate.py` for scope-aware git safety.
- `status` and `stop` are background-only controls. Foreground runs stay in the current session and therefore do not use runtime controller artifacts.
- `Mode: exec` remains the advanced / CI path for fully specified non-interactive runs.

## Safety Model

| Concern | How it is handled |
|---------|-------------------|
| Dirty worktree | Runtime preflight blocks launch or relaunch until out-of-scope changes are cleaned up or isolated |
| Health / state drift | Runtime preflight runs resume-helper-based integrity checks before every detached session and relaunch |
| Failed change | Uses the rollback strategy approved before launch: approved hard reset in an isolated experiment branch/worktree, otherwise `git revert --no-edit HEAD`; results log remains the audit trail |
| Guard failure | Up to 2 rework attempts before discarding |
| Syntax error | Auto-fix immediately, does not count as iteration |
| Runtime crash | Up to 3 fix attempts, then skip |
| Resource exhaustion | Revert, try smaller variant |
| Hanging process | Kill after timeout, revert |
| Stuck (3+ discards) | REFINE strategy; 5+ discards -> PIVOT to new approach; escalate to web search if needed |
| Ambiguity mid-loop | Apply best practices autonomously; never pause to ask the user |
| External side effects | `ship` mode requires explicit confirmation during the pre-launch wizard |
| Environment limits | Probed at startup; infeasible hypotheses filtered automatically |
| Interrupted session | Resume from last consistent state on next invocation |
| Context drift (long runs) | Protocol Fingerprint Check every 10 iterations; increase check frequency after compaction; re-read from disk on failure |

## FAQ

**How do I pick a metric?** Use `Mode: plan`. It analyzes your codebase and suggests one.

**Works with any language?** Yes. The protocol is language-agnostic. Only the verify command is domain-specific.

**How do I stop it?** In foreground mode, interrupt the active Codex session. In background mode, ask `$codex-autoresearch` to stop the current run, or call `python3 <skill-root>/scripts/autoresearch_runtime_ctl.py stop --repo <repo>` if you are automating the backend directly. `Iterations: N` and stop conditions still work too.

**Does security mode touch my code?** No. Read-only analysis. Tell Codex to "also fix critical findings" during setup to opt into remediation.

**How many iterations?** Depends on the task. 5 for targeted fixes, 10-20 for exploration, unlimited for overnight runs.

**Does it learn across runs?** Yes. Lessons are extracted after each kept iteration, after each pivot, and at runtime completion when no recent lesson exists. The lessons file persists across sessions and is consulted at the start of the next run.

**Can it resume after an interruption?** Yes. Foreground runs resume from `research-results.tsv` plus `autoresearch-state.json`. Background runs also need an existing `autoresearch-launch.json`; if that confirmed launch state is missing, start a new background run through the normal launch flow instead.

**Can it search the web?** Yes, when stuck after multiple strategy pivots. Web search results are treated as hypotheses and verified mechanically.

**How do I use it in CI?** Use `Mode: exec` or `codex exec`. In controlled automation environments, this skill now assumes full-access execution by default, so prefer `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox ...` unless you intentionally want to reproduce workspace-write sandbox behavior. Configure Codex CLI authentication first; API key auth is preferred for CI/programmatic use. All config is provided upfront, output is JSON, and exit codes indicate success/failure.

**Can it test multiple ideas at once?** Yes. Enable parallel experiments during setup. It uses git worktrees to test up to 3 hypotheses simultaneously.
